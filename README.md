# Automatic-Water-Dispenser

Why Automatic Water Dispenser?
  > About 71% of the Earth is covered with water, but sadly only 2.5% of it is drinking water. With rise in population,pollution and climate change, it is expected that by as soon as 2025 we will experience perennial water shortage .It might not appear big at the first time, but if your tap dripped a drop of water every second it would take only about five hours for you to waste one gallon of water,that is enough water for an average human to survive for two days.
  > So what can be done to stop this?

Here comes the role of automatic water Dispenser.
